# Github profile
 A single page application which reactively searches through GitHub users and updates search results as user types.

## Documentation
Instructions:
  Results should be displayed in a card-like fashion under the search bar. Each user is supposed to be represented as a card. That card should contain public user information from the open GitHub API like avatar, name, number of repositories, languages used, etc. On user card click we should be able to retrieve and see information (both plain and aggregated) about user's repositories in the most appropriate UX/UI solution of your choice whether it is a new page or a modal screen, may be an unfolding card, or something more suitable for the problem?
